# Practice: Bus
Using the [Web Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) and the [TriMet Web Services API](http://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/), this web page will, when loaded, display a list of all of the bus lines that have stops within 100 meters of the user's current location.
Then it provides a link for each bus line to it's map (e.g. [line 14 map](http://trimet.org/schedules/r014.htm)).
