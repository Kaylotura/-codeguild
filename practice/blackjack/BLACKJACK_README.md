# Blackjack

An exercise in implementing the scoring of a single hand of [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

## Exercise Goals
* Make a class that represents a card with a suit and a rank.
* Make a class that represents a hand with a list of cards.
* Add functions that adds a card to a hand, one that scores a hand, and one that returns if the score is over 21.
* Test out your classes and functions by constructing instances in code from literals. E.g. Make the jack of diamonds.
* Allow a user to type in a hand and have it be converted into card objects and then scored.
* Represent all cards in your program by _instance of the card_ class. 

## Scoring
* Cards have integer point values.
* Aces are 1 or 11, number cards are their number, face cards are all 10.
* A hand is worth the sum of all the points of the cards in it.
* An ace is worth 1 when the hand it's a part of would be over 21 if it was worth 11.


## Future Goals
* Model a full game.
